      Writing a paragraph is what you might do in an essay. I haven't had to write a formal essay for a while.
      <br><br>I <em><strong>hope</strong></em> my writing skills don't dwindle too much while I'm not excercising them....
      <br>However, I'm becoming increasingly comfortable with writing in PL/SQL.

      I am Lyr II, a tube amplifier.<br>
      I use a very high voltage transformer to make my tubes hot, which eventually - through some sort of science -
      amplifies an analog audio signal to set headphones on fire.
      <br>Of course I'm kidding. I'm not a pyromaniac... just don't set me on high gain with the volume cranked up with some poor unfortunate low impedance headphones plugged in.
